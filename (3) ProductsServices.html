            <div class="textbox"> <h1> What are the benefits and why you should regularly clean your pen? </h1>
                <p>
					There are many benefits that comes with using a fountain pen especially for everyday use, 
                    not only are you writing with a smooth-flowing pen and feeling luxurious regardless of the 
                    price of the pen that you are using- but you are also helping by reducing the amount of 
                    plastic wastes that you produce!
                </p>
				<p>
					A fountain pen typically lasts for months, years, up to generations! some have considered 
                    their pens a family heirloom which gives perspective how diverse fountain pens can become. 
                    With these pens lasting longer than your average pen, this means that you don't throw as 
                    much waste. Using a normal pen would only last you for a few weeks and you're going to be 
                    surprise that it has gone missing or even stolen, which leads to you purchasing another set 
                    of pens to use.
                </p>		
				<p>
					Having a clean fountain pen ensures that it functions properly without any stuttering in the 
                    line strokes. For those who are everyday users of fountain pens, having a routine or daily care 
                    habit for their fountain pens are always a must to minimize fountain pen-related stress.
                </p>			
				<p> 
					There are some who neglects the maintenance needed in order to take care of their fountain pens, 
                    this causes drying of ink within the ink reservoir where the ink flows from the cartridge unto 
                    the nib and causes it to clog and if prolonged, can damage the material used in the fountain pen
